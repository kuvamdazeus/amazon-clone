## Basic CRUD application

Functionality: Add to cart, buy individual item, checkout from cart, cancel orders, see previous orders, user sign in & authentication
Used [FakestoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com) to sample products onto website

Technologies used: ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB & Redux

If features aren't working or the products aren't loading,
Thanks to heroku for less "Free dyno hours" :)

I regret not using Tailwind here ðŸ˜“
